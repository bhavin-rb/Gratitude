      <p>If I can tell you about a magic potion that can give you everything you want, yes everything you desire: better health,
        abundance, improved relationships, happiness, joy, fullfilment... small effort is required from you. So let me tell you what this magic potion is; It is <span>"GRATITUDE"</span>. 
      </p>
      <p>As the holy book says, those who have will be given more and those who don't have, even whatever they have will be taken away, if they are not GRATEFUL.</p>
      <p>The more you are in a state of GRATITUDE, the more you will attract good things to be GRATEFUL. Your life is a gift given to you and every moment is a gift. Are you GRATEFUL that you are alive? Enjoy the little things now, one day you will realize that they were the big things. These are the beautiful gifts you already have. Human nature is always trying to find the missing things and while not being GRATEFUL to all the little things they have and they had.  So live today as if it is your frist day of your life and also as if it is your last day of your life. Forget yesterday as it has already forgotten you. Don't sweat for tommorrow as you haven't even met, instead, open your eyes and heart to a trully precious gift of 'TODAY' in your life. Live and embrace the PRESENT and be GRATEFUL for the same.<br><br>You have a choice to make. Either wait for a special day or celebrate each day as a special day. Say THANK YOU to all the good things in your life right now. Say THANK YOU to all the things you had in life and also say THANK YOU in advance for all the things you want in your life, as if it has already happened.  When you say THANK YOU, feel it in your heart and miracles will start happening in your life. </p>
      <p>If you want your life to be better in every possible way, all you have to be is GRATEFUL. When you wake up tomorrow morning, please spend at least five minutes to  count your blessings and write them in your grtatitude journal. Take a moment to recognize all the blessings and all the gifts you have. Therefore, to live a happy and fullfiled life, develop an <span>ATTITUDE of GRATITUDE</span>.</p>
